# 🛡️ Cyber Security Learnings – Day 2 (04 March 2025)

## 🔍 Understanding Defensive Security  

Defensive security focuses on **preventing cyber attacks** and **detecting intrusions** if they happen.  

🔹 **Red Team** (Attackers) = Offensive Security (Hacking)  
🔹 **Blue Team** (Defenders) = Defensive Security (Protection)  

### 🎯 Goals of Defensive Security  
1. **Prevent intrusions** – Stop hackers from getting in.  
2. **Detect intrusions** – If hackers get in, find them quickly and stop them.  

## 🏰 Key Tasks in Defensive Security  

### 1️⃣ User Cyber Security Awareness  
👨‍💻 **Example**: Training employees to recognize phishing emails and avoid clicking malicious links.  

### 2️⃣ Documenting and Managing Assets  
🖥️ **Example**: Keeping an inventory of company devices to ensure everything is protected.  

### 3️⃣ Updating and Patching Systems  
🔄 **Example**: Regularly updating Windows and security software to fix vulnerabilities.  

### 4️⃣ Setting Up Preventative Security Devices  
🛑 **Firewalls** – Control which traffic enters or leaves the network.  
🛡️ **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** – Block attacks based on known threats.  
🔍 **Example**: A firewall blocking access to dangerous websites.  

### 5️⃣ Logging and Monitoring for Threats  
👀 **Example**: A company monitoring network traffic to detect unusual activity.

## 🔎 Related Topics in Defensive Security  

### 🔹 Security Operations Center (SOC)  
👮 **What it does**: A team that monitors security threats 24/7.  
🏢 **Example**: Google has a SOC that watches for cyber threats in real-time.  

### 🔹 Threat Intelligence  
🔍 **What it does**: Analyzes hacker techniques to predict future attacks.  
📌 **Example**: Learning from past ransomware attacks to improve security.  

### 🔹 Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)  
🕵️ **What it does**: Investigates cyber crimes and traces hacker activities.  
🔬 **Example**: Investigating a data breach caused by a stolen password.  

### 🔹 Malware Analysis  
💀 **What it does**: Studies malware to understand how it works and how to stop it.  
🐛 **Example**: Analyzing a suspicious email attachment for hidden viruses.
