## 🔬 Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)  

DFIR is a branch of cybersecurity that deals with investigating cyber incidents and responding to security threats effectively.  

### 🕵️ Digital Forensics  
Digital Forensics helps analyze evidence related to cyberattacks, intellectual property theft, and cyber espionage.  

#### 🖥️ Key Areas of Digital Forensics:  
- **File System Analysis**: Recovering deleted or modified files.  
- **Memory Analysis**: Investigating malicious processes in system memory.  
- **System Logs Analysis**: Identifying unauthorized system activities.  
- **Network Logs**: Tracking attack sources and methodologies.  

### ⚡ Incident Response (IR)  
Incident response is the process of handling cyber incidents such as data breaches and system intrusions.  

**🔄 The 4 Phases of Incident Response:**  
1. **Preparation:** Develop an incident response plan.  
2. **Detection & Analysis:** Identify and assess incidents.  
3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery:** Limit damage and restore systems.  
4. **Post-Incident Activity:** Document lessons learned and improve defenses.
